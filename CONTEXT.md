# FLYBETA — Project Context

---

## 🦅 The Vision: Gen Beta Takes Flight

FlyBeta is a gamified, hands-on tech academy engineered to accelerate the upcoming generation (Gen Beta) into rapid technical mastery (Fly). The core philosophy is strictly **anti-tutorial hell**: no boring videos, just pure code. The platform is designed to teach users how to ship end-to-end applications by building real-world projects rather than toy examples, enforcing a standard of **actual capability over passive watching**.

---

## Current State of the Project

### 1. Core Architecture & Curriculum
The platform is built on a React frontend powered by Tailwind CSS. The curriculum is currently divided into three primary terminal tracks:
- **TS-01**: Data Science
- **TS-02**: AI & Machine Learning
- **TS-03**: Cloud Computing

### 2. The Gamified Learning Engine
FlyBeta operates on a structured loop to keep users engaged and accountable:
- **Interactive Labs**: Hands-on coding environments utilizing flip cards and real-world analogies.
- **Boss Quizzes**: Hard-stop evaluations at the end of every level that users must pass to unlock the next stage of the curriculum.
- **AI Evaluator**: A final capstone grading system powered by Google Gemini to analyze user-submitted GitHub repositories and provide real, actionable feedback.

### 3. UI/UX & Branding
The design language fuses high-energy **Neo-Brutalism** with clean, premium branding:
- **Aesthetic**: Grid-paper backgrounds, thick black borders, asymmetrical tilted cards, aggressive drop shadows, and kinetic elements like the scrolling marquee.
- **Logo & Identity**: A bespoke, high-resolution halftone white bird in flight against a stark background, paired with heavy, uppercase, tracking-tight typography.
- **Navigation Split**: A clean, conversion-focused header for the landing page featuring a single "Get Started" call-to-action, structurally separated from the internal dashboard navbar which tracks user XP, Streaks 🔥, Coins, and houses the theme toggler.

### 4. Development Workflow
The project is being rapidly prototyped and built utilizing agentic AI coding workflows (via Antigravity IDE), leveraging a strict Context → Goal → Constraints prompt structure to generate precise, production-ready components.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap: What Remains to be Built

### Curriculum Content Population
The structural shells for the tracks are built, but the actual educational content must be written. This involves populating the JSON or database structures with the interactive lessons, the specific Boss Quiz questions, and the parameters for the capstone projects.

### Performance & Monitoring
Add application performance monitoring, error tracking, and analytics to the production deployment.

## Build Log

### Phase 11 — Complete
User Dashboard (Profile API, Rank Progression, Theme Persistence).

### What's Done
- Django project scaffold (`flybeta` config) in `/backend`
- 3 Django apps: `accounts`, `learn`, `api`
- All models: `UserProfile`, `Domain`, `Level`, `Lesson` (+ `illustration_url`), `DomainProgress`, `LevelProgress`
- UserProfile auto-creation via post_save signal
- Admin registrations with filters, inlines, and search
- SQLite database created and migrated
- DRF read-only API at `/api/v1/` (domains, levels, lessons)
- Content pipeline: `python manage.py load_level_content` (JSON → DB, supports `illustration_url`)
- **Full curriculum**: 3 tracks × 10 levels = 30 JSON content files loaded into DB
- React + Vite + Tailwind v4 frontend in `/frontend`
- Design system: All DESIGN.md tokens mapped to CSS custom properties
- 3 pages: Track Selection, Track Roadmap, Lesson Runner
- 5 components: Navbar, Layout, TrackCard, LevelNode, MarkdownRenderer
- **Interactive components**: `FlipCard` (3D Neo-Brutalist flip card, click-to-flip)
- **MarkdownRenderer upgrade**: `rehype-raw` plugin for custom HTML tag parsing (`<flipcard>` → `<FlipCard/>`)
- API service layer with Axios + Vite proxy
- Stitch prototypes preserved at `/design/stitch-reference/`
- Mock auth with dev user (`python manage.py create_dev_user`)
- `GET /api/v1/users/me/` — user gamification stats endpoint
- `POST /api/v1/lessons/{id}/complete/` — XP/coins award, streak logic, level completion
- `UserContext` — live gamification state in Navbar, reward flash on lesson complete
- `ThemeContext` — 5 themes with CSS variable swapping, localStorage persistence
- **Phase 4a**: Project Architect (Blueprint Lab) UI & mock endpoint (`POST /api/v1/ai/architect/`)
- **Phase 4b**: Code Reviewer (Code Drishti) UI & mock endpoint (`POST /api/v1/ai/reviewer/`)
- **Phase 4c**: Full curriculum expansion (Levels 1–7 for all 3 tracks)
- **Phase 4d**: Multi-theme system (5 themes with character images, backgrounds, overlays)
- **Phase 5**: Vision Suite UI Scaffold (Oracle Widget, Channel Feed, Synapse Engine, Video Detail 60/40 Split)
- **Phase 6**: Real AI API integration (Gemini 2.5 Flash for Oracle, Synapse, Architect, Code Review)
- **Phase 7 (Completed)**: Beginner Curriculum Upgrade 
  - Complete rewrite of 30 levels across all 3 tracks with strong metaphors.
  - Interactive `<FlipCard/>` components embedded in all lessons.
  - `LevelBossQuiz` gatekeeper (60% pass rate) implemented for all 30 levels.
  - Track Roadmap UI updated to enforce level locking based on user progress.
  - `pass_quiz` API endpoint added to unlock levels and award XP.
- **Phase 8 (Completed)**: The AI Evaluator (Level 10 Capstone)
  - Created `CapstoneSubmission` model and `CapstoneSubmissionViewSet` API.
  - Built GitHub service (`github_service.py`) to fetch repository contents via authenticated Github API.
  - Integrated Google Gemini API (`ai_evaluator.py`) using `gemini-pro` for automated code evaluation.
  - Developed `<CapstoneEvaluator/>` Neo-Brutalist frontend component with rich Markdown rendering and success/fail states.
  - Conditionally injected Capstone UI into `LessonRunnerPage` for Level 10.

- **Phase 7 (Completed)**: Production DB & Curriculum Expansion
  - Migrated to Supabase PostgreSQL (Mumbai) on port 443.
  - Recovered rich lesson content JSONs from git history (commit `ef902a2`).
  - Updated `load_level_content.py` to wipe data before seeding.
  - Successfully seeded 3 Domains, 30 Levels, and 98 Lessons.
- **Phase 8 (Completed)**: AI Services Restoration
  - Fixed `403 Forbidden` errors on AI endpoints with `@authentication_classes([])`.
  - Upgraded Oracle, Architect, and Code Review services to `gemini-3.6-flash`.
  - Added traceback logging for resilient error handling.
- **Phase 9 (Completed)**: WebP Asset Optimization
  - Converted 24 heavy PNG/JPEG theme assets (56.5MB) to WebP (4.9MB) via Pillow batch script (91% savings).
  - Fixed EXIF orientation issues in the Anime theme background via `exif_transpose`.
  - Updated `Layout.jsx` and `TrackCard.jsx` to reference `.webp`.
- **Phase 10 (Completed)**: JWT Authentication, Email Delivery & Freemium Gating
  - Custom `CustomUser` model (replaces default User) with `name`, `username` (unique), `email` (unique).
  - `StudentProfile` (1:1 with `CustomUser`) merges gamification fields: `xp`, `coins`, `streak`, `last_active_date`, `total_xp`, `current_rank`, `theme_preference`.
  - `post_save` signal auto-creates `StudentProfile` on every new user registration.
  - JWT via `djangorestframework-simplejwt`: Register, Login (token pair), Refresh, Logout (blacklist), `/users/me/`.
  - Password Reset flow: request (async SMTP thread) + confirm (UID/token validation).
  - SMTP configured via environment variables; email dispatched in a `threading.Thread(daemon=True)` for zero-latency API responses.
  - Frontend `AuthContext` replaces old `UserContext` — manages access/refresh JWTs in `localStorage`, decodes user state, and emits `flybeta:logout` on refresh failure.
  - `api.js` Axios interceptors: inject `Bearer` token on every request; auto-refresh on `401` and retry the original request.
  - `AuthModal.jsx`: Register / Login / Forgot Password in a single modal with `customMessage` and `initialView` props for programmatic triggers.
  - `ResetPasswordConfirmPage.jsx`: Standalone route at `/reset-password/:uid/:token` for password confirmation.
  - Freemium gating: Level 1 free for guests; Level 2+ and Capstone evaluator intercept unauthenticated access and pop the `AuthModal`.
  - Both Navbars (`Navbar`, `LandingNavbar`) are auth-aware, rendering real user stats when logged in.
- **Phase 11 (Completed)**: User Dashboard + Profile Editing
  - `RANK_LADDER` constant on `StudentProfile` — 8-tier XP-based ranking (Novice 0 → Legend 40,000).
  - `compute_rank()`, `next_rank`, `xp_to_next_rank`, `rank_progress_pct` model helpers.
  - `VALID_THEMES` set on `StudentProfile` — server-side theme validation.
  - `avatar` (ImageField) and `bio` (TextField, 160 char) fields on `StudentProfile`.
  - `UserProfileSerializer` — full dashboard payload with identity, gamification, rank progress, avatar, bio, and theme.
  - `UserProfileView` (GET + PATCH) at `/api/v1/users/profile/` — supports multipart file uploads for avatar; accepts name, bio, avatar, theme_preference (all optional).
  - `DashboardPage.jsx` — Hero identity card (with avatar), XP/rank progress bar, track progress bars, theme selector grid, and bio display.
  - `EditProfileModal.jsx` — Neo-Brutalist modal for editing name, bio, and uploading avatar with image preview.
  - Auth-only "Dashboard" nav link in `Navbar.jsx`.
  - Theme selector syncs `ThemeContext` (instant) + backend persistence (async PATCH).
  - Username and display name casing fix — inline `textTransform: 'none'` overrides on `heading-lg` and `label-mono`.
  - `MEDIA_URL` / `MEDIA_ROOT` configured in `settings.py`; `/media` served in development; Vite proxies `/media` to Django.
  - **Phase 11c**: XP State Sync — squashed `get_dev_user` in DRF views, enforced `IsAuthenticated`, fixed `total_xp` math, unified `AuthContext` to fetch from `/users/profile/` (rich payload), and removed redundant local state in `DashboardPage.jsx` so Navbar and Dashboard sync instantly.
- **Phase 12 (Completed)**: SIH MoSPI Rebranding & Diagnostic Flow
  - Rebranded platform for MoSPI Smart Skills Intelligence — FRAC competency framework.
  - Built 12-question Diagnostic Assessment with real-time scoring per FRAC quadrant.
  - Pre-signup skill gap analysis — users see results before creating an account.
  - `DiagnosticPage.jsx` — profile intake + quiz + results with radar chart.
  - `TrackRoadmapPage.jsx` — learning track roadmaps per FRAC competency.
  - `AdminDashboardPage.jsx` — Division Heatmap, Cadre Analysis, Training Effectiveness analytics.
  - `TourGuide.jsx` — 11-step guided onboarding using driver.js across 4 pages.
  - Oracle Widget powered by Gemini AI for contextual Q&A.
  - Quiz Engine for competency-based assessments.
- **Phase 13 (Completed)**: Mobile & UX Polish
  - Responsive navbar with hamburger menu at `lg` breakpoint (1024px).
  - Mobile-optimized: ThemePickerModal, DiagnosticPage, AuthModal, Tour Popover, AdminDashboardPage.
  - Full-width stacked tab buttons on mobile admin dashboard.
  - Tour guide back button navigates to previous page.
  - Fixed 415 Unsupported Media Type on profile PATCH (added `JSONParser`).
  - CORS origins auto-stripped of trailing slashes.
- **Phase 14 (Completed)**: Production Deployment
  - Configured frontend deployment on Vercel (`flybeta-sih.vercel.app`).
  - Switched backend deployment to Railway (`flybeta.up.railway.app`) to eliminate cold start delays.
  - Setup `.env.production` routing and secure environment variables across both platforms.
  - Mitigated Django CORS header strictness to support production API access.
  - Fixed Tour Guide React Hook crash (Minified Error #310) when API fetches failed or triggered early returns.
- **Phase 16 (Completed)**: Labs Redesign & Doc Quiz Engine
  - Replaced Code Drishti (`/labs/reviewer`) with **Doc Quiz Engine** (`/labs/quiz-generator`).
  - New page: drag-and-drop PDF/PPTX upload → AI generates FRAC-tagged MCQs with instant grading and explanations.
  - Backend already had `POST /api/v1/ai/doc-quiz/` endpoint; this phase added the frontend page.
  - Updated LabsSubNav, App.jsx routes, and TourGuide tour step.
  - Added password visibility toggle (eye icon) to all auth forms.
  - Fixed Django 5.2 `STORAGES` config (missing `default` key) causing 500 on profile fetch.
  - Fixed `TrackRoadmapPage.jsx` ReferenceError crash (variable used before declaration).
  - Fixed TourGuide global step counter (`popover.progress` vs `popover.progressText`).

### What's Next
- **Phase 17**: AI-Powered Personalized Skill Gap Assessment
  - Replace hardcoded 12-MCQ diagnostic with **Gemini-generated personalized quiz**.
  - 4 FRAC sections × 5 questions (4 MCQs @ 1 mark + 1 descriptive @ 5 marks) = **36 marks total**.
  - AI tailors questions based on user's designation, division, years of service, and previous trainings.
  - No live feedback during quiz — full results overview only after submission.
  - Descriptive answers (50-100 words) evaluated leniently by Gemini with partial credit.
  - New `DiagnosticAttempt` model to persist attempt history with per-section scores.
  - Attempt history table with date, time, and score breakdown.
  - Score trend charts, adaptive difficulty, and competency badges (stretch goals).

**Architecture:**
- `THEME_IMAGES` map in `TrackCard.jsx` — per-theme domain→character mapping
- `THEME_BACKGROUNDS` map in `Layout.jsx` — per-theme background image paths
- 80% opacity cream overlay (`#F9F8F6`) for all themed backgrounds (readability)
- Content sits at `z-10` above the fixed background overlay
- Neo-Brutalism (default) uses no background image — just the `grid-bg` pattern
